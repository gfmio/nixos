# new dotfile config & setup

This repo contains all of my general dotfiles as well as systemd config for running gnome services alongside sway and i3 for a better desktop experience.

## Structure

All dotfiles in the home directory symlink to their respective versions in this repo.

Any .config directories are linked here.\

The .local files are copied over.




## Current issues

- Monitors are not working
- xrdp is not working and generally sucks
- i3 and sway aren't fully configured and not doing the same thing
- there's no display manager
- there's no fully functioning desktop environment

## Goals

- Fully configured everything: Sound, Graphics, Networking, ...
- Login manager
- RDP, VNC
- Firewall
- ZSH
- vim
- desktop background
- all the keybindings
- dmenu
- screen calibration
